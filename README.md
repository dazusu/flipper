# flipper
Flipper is a Final Fantasy XI bot that can reliably automate Salvage, Legion, and other routine events. Flipper is powered by EliteAPI (https://www.elitemmonetwork.com/) and FFXINAV (by xenonsmurf) and works best with Windower 4.

**Acknowledgments**

Flipper makes use of code or ideas from other software developers within the Final Fantasy XI community. Following is a list of projects/codebases from which ideas or code have been borrowed. This list is not conclusive:

* FFXINAV by Xenonsmurf
* EliteAPI (https://www.elitemmonetwork.com)
* Enumerations/structs/wrappers from various projects, including FFACETools and EasyFarm

**Expectations**

Flipper was not designed or built for public release, nor is it polished (lots-o-bugs). It is being released now for posterity and in the hope that it is helpful to those who still play Final Fantasy XI. Flipper is not better than anything that's currently in the public domain - but it does explore event automation ideas that other developers have not (yet?) made public, such as Salvage, Dynamis, Legion, Abyssea, SR, and HTMBs.

With that being said, Flipper will likely not work out of the box for you, and if it does work - it will require specific job/sub-job combinations. Namely, THF/RDM, THF/WAR, or [DD]/WAR (depending on usage).

Flipper's operation is a mix of inputs via EliteAPI, and packet-exchanges facilitated via a Windower 4 addon, which is included in this repository.

Flipper is provided as is.

**Issues**

Please submit issues, and where time permits, I will address them; I will also accept PRs.
