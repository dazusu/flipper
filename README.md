# flipper
Flipper is a Final Fantasy XI bot that can reliably automate Salvage, Legion, and other routine events. Flipper is powered by EliteAPI (https://www.elitemmonetwork.com/) and FFXINAV (by xenonsmurf) and works best with Windower 4.

Flipper's source code will be made available towards the end of 2023.
